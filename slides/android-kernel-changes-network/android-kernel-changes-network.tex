  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the standard Linux kernel, every application can open
    sockets and communicate over the Network
  \item However, Google was willing to apply a more strict policy with
    regard to network access
  \item Access to the network is a permission, with a per application
    granularity
  \item Filtered with the GID
  \item You need it to access IP, Bluetooth, raw sockets or RFCOMM
  \end{itemize}
