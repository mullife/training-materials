  \frametitle{Android Open Source Project (AOSP)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item At every new version, Google releases its source code
    through this project so that community and vendors can
    work with it.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One major exception: Honeycomb has not been released because
      Google stated that its source code was not clean enough to
      release it.
    \end{itemize}
  \item One can fetch the source code and contribute to it, even though
    the development process is very locked by Google
  \item Now many devices are supported through AOSP though, such as Mobile/TV/Auto/Things/Tablet, also Wear
