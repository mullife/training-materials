  \frametitle{Android Open Source Project (AOSP)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item At every new version, Google releases its source code
    through this project so that community and vendors can
    work with it.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One major exception: Honeycomb has not been released because
      Google stated that its source code was not clean enough to
      release it.
    \end{itemize}
  \item One can fetch the source code and contribute to it, even though
    the development process is very locked by Google
  \item Only a few devices are supported through AOSP though, only the
    two most recent Android development phones and tablets (part of
    the Nexus brand) and the pandaboard
  \end{itemize}
