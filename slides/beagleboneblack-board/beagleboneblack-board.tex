\frametitle{Do not damage your BeagleBone Black!}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not remove power abruptly:
  \begin{itemize}
     \item Boards components have been damaged by removing the power or
           USB cable in an abrupt way, not leaving the PMIC the time to
           switch off the components in a clean way. See
           \url{http://bit.ly/1FWHNZi}
     \item Reboot (\code{reboot}) or shutdown (\code{halt}) the board
	   in software when Linux is running.
     \item You can also press the \code{RESET} button to reset and
	   reboot.
     \item When there is no software way, you can also switch off
	   the board by pressing the \code{POWER} button for 8 seconds.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Do not leave your board powered on a metallic surface (like a
        laptop with a metal finish).
\end{itemize}
