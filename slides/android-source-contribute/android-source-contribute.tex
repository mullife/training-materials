  \item For the Android development process, Google also developed a
    tool to manage projects and ease code reviews.
  \item It once again uses Git to do so and Repo is also built around
    it so that you can easily contribute to Android
  \item To do so, start a new branch with \code{repo start <branchname>}
  \item Do your usual commits with Git
  \item When you are done, upload to Gerrit using \code{repo upload}
  \end{itemize}
