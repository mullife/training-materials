\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Suspend to RAM}
\begin{itemize}
\item Used mostly on phones (Android, Firefox OS, ...) and PCs.
\item May drain the battery too fast in devices that are idle most of the time or
      for a long time (e.g. digital cameras, motion detecting video surveillance).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hibernate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Also called suspend to disk.
\item Used in SONY digital cameras (booting in about 1s).
\item Used in credit card payment terminals (our customer).
\item Requires sufficient amount of RAM and storage (NAND, eMMC, ...).
      Storage has to be fast enough.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Checkpointing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Similar to hibernate, but the state of the system is selectively saved
      to disk. It will require less storage and will probably boot faster.
\item For Android, have a look at:
