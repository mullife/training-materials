  \begin{itemize}
  \item When the system goes out of memory, Linux throws the OOM
    Killer to cleanup memory greedy processes
  \item The main idea is to have another process killer, that kicks in
    before the OOM Killer and takes into account the time since the
    application was last used and the priority of the component
    for the system
  \item It uses various thresholds, so that it first notifies
    applications so that they can save their state, then begins to kill
    non-critical background processes, and then the foreground
    applications
  \item As it is run to free memory before the OOM Killer, the latter
    will never be run, as the system will never run out of memory
  \item In Android 9, a userspace lowmemorykiller daemon (lmkd) features is added.
